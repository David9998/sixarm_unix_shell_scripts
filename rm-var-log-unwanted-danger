# Remove /var/log files that we don't want.
#
# We use this to clean up drive space.
#
# Remove these files:
#
#   * Compressed files. These end in .bz2, .bzip, .gz, .tgz, .zip.
#   * Rotation files. These end in .1, .2, .3, etc.
#   * dist-upgrade/*
#   * nagios3/archives/*
#   * samba/log*
#   * unattended-upgrades/unattended-upgrades-dpkg_*.log
#
# Compatibility:
#
#   * We prefer to be more compatible rather than system-specific.
#
#   * To delete files, we prefer `-exec rm` vs. `-delete`.
#     The former is more compatible, the latter is faster.
#
#   * To regex, we prefer patterns to be basic vs. extended.
#     The former is more compatible, the latter is more modern.
